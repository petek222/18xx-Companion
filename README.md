# 18xx-Companion

This app serves as my self-tutorial of the Swift programming language. One of my hobbies in the 18XX series of boardgames,
a genre of train games about investing, running, and building successful railroad companies all over the world in the 1800s (hence the '18XX' moniker). 
These games are quite deep and complex, so any information that could be provided at a glance can help streamline play for new and experienced players alike.
In addition to being an informational app that provides data that is less obvious for the various implemented titles (tile manifests, train rosters, private companies, rules reference, etc.),
I also intend to add an automated scoring feature that can simplify the oft time-consuming processing of scoring at the end of a game. 
While similar computer applications like Lemmy's moderator and other excel-based tools exist to provide similar functionality, nothing
exists that follows the clean simplicity of the iOS design language. My hope with this app is to eventually publish it for free on the App store. 

Below are the titles currently in-progress, with many more along the way:
1830: Railways and Robber Barons <br />
1889: History of Shikoku Railways <br />
1846: The Race for the Midwest <br />
1862: Railway Mania in the Eastern Counties <br />
18Chesapeake: The Birth of American Railroads <br />
18MEX: The Railway comes to Mexico <br />
